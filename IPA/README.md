# IPA for Bengali Texts
IPA: IPA transcription is like a decoder ring for language sounds. It's a system that allows us to capture spoken sounds and translate them into written symbols. These symbols, known as IPA symbols, provide a visual representation of how words are pronounced, regardless of the language they belong to. Think of IPA transcription as a universal language that linguists use to communicate the sounds of languages across the globe.
