# About Dataset
Emo-DB Database : 
The EMODB database is the freely available German emotional database. The database is created by the Institute of Communication Science, Technical University, Berlin, Germany. Ten professional speakers (five males and five females) participated in data recording. The database contains a total of 535 utterances. The EMODB database comprises of seven emotions: 1) anger; 2) boredom; 3) anxiety; 4) happiness; 5) sadness; 6) disgust; and 7) neutral. The data was recorded at a 48-kHz sampling rate and then down-sampled to 16-kHz.

Additional Information:
Every utterance is named according to the same scheme:

- Positions 1-2: number of speaker
- Positions 3-5: code for text
- Position 6: emotion (sorry, letter stands for german emotion word)
- Position 7: if there are more than two versions these are numbered a, b, c ....

    - Example: 03a01Fa.wav is the audio file from Speaker 03 speaking text a01 with the emotion "Freude" (Happiness).
