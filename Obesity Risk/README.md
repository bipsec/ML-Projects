# About Dataset
Competition Name: multiclass_classification_obesity

About this Competition:

- The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Obesity or CVD risk dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

Note: This dataset is particularly well suited for visualizations, clustering, and general EDA. Show off your skills!

Files
- train.csv - the training dataset; NObeyesdad is the categorical target
- test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the class of NObeyesdad for each row
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format


# Multi Class Classification
This notebook refers to multiclass classification task. I have participated in this contest and applied RandomForestClassifier, Logistic Regression, GradientBoosting and after comparing the best outcome I have utilized that as my proposed methods and submitted the outcome in the competition.
